# Multi-Protocol Network App

### Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a network application implementing multiple protocols (RUDP, TCP, DHCP, DNS).  
The system allows a client to select an image (cat, dog, koala, or ant) and request it via a reliable UDP (RUDP) connection to the APP server, which connects via TCP to a HELP server to retrieve the requested image and then sends it back to the client over UDP.  
The project showcases multi-protocol communication with a focus on network traffic and reliability.

### Project Structure

- **Client.py** – The client side, performs DHCP and DNS requests and initiates RUDP connection to select and receive an image.  
- **APPserver.py** – Application server managing RUDP connection with the client and TCP connection with the HELP server to fetch image files.  
- **HELPserver.py** – Helper TCP server that sends image files to the APP server upon request.  
- **main.py** – Sample script generated by PyCharm (not directly related to the network functions).

### Requirements & Installation

1. Python 3.6 or higher  
2. Install required libraries:  
\`\`\`bash
pip install scapy pillow
\`\`\`

3. Make sure image files (cat.jpg, dog.jpg, koala.jpg, ant.jpg) are in the project directory.

### How to Run

1. Start the HELP server:  
\`\`\`bash
python HELPserver.py
\`\`\`

2. Start the APP server:  
\`\`\`bash
python APPserver.py
\`\`\`

3. Run the Client:  
\`\`\`bash
python Client.py
\`\`\`

4. Follow the prompt in the client to select an image by entering a number (1-4). Status messages will be displayed during the process.

### Technical Details

- **RUDP (Reliable UDP):** Implements a simple reliable UDP protocol with sequence numbers and acknowledgments between Client and APPserver.  
- **TCP:** Used for communication between APPserver and HELPserver to transfer image files.  
- **DHCP and DNS:** Client includes example functions demonstrating DHCP and DNS packet creation and sniffing (not fully integrated into the main flow).  
- **Image Handling:** HELPserver sends the requested image file to APPserver over TCP, which then sends it to the client via UDP.

### Possible Improvements

- Add more robust error handling.  
- Extend support for additional protocols.  
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier image selection.  
- Further refine the RUDP protocol implementation.
